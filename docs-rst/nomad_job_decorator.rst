Nomad Job Decorator
======================

.. note:: If a Nomad Decorator is used with ``NomadExecutor``, it introduces the overhead of two task executions each time (as ``NomadExecutor`` is running every task as a Nomad job). In case this is undesirable, Airflow can be configured with multiple executors, and Nomad Operators can be used with ``LocalExecutor``

The ``nomad_job`` decorator is a wrapper around the ``NomadJobOperator``. For a detailed description please refer to the `Nomad Job Operator <nomad_job_operator.html>`_ documentation. 


Parameters
############

The ``nomad_job`` decorator takes the same parameters as the ``NomadJobOperator``, except the ``template_content`` parameter.

Instead, the content of the template could be added as the Python function body decorated by ``nomad_job``.
